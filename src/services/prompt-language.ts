[Deliverable]
Produce a structured 300–500 word premise with exactly these Markdown sections:

State the protagonist, inciting event, necessary action, and consequence of failure in one sentence.

## Core Conflict Chain
Connect the initial predicament, inciting disruption, primary goal, and opposing force.

## Central Advantage
Define how it is obtained, how it works, how it interacts with the world rules, how it progresses, and its cost or limit.

## Suspense Framework
State the immediate visible threat and the deeper hidden truth or long-term mystery.

[Requirements]
1. Make the central advantage a specific plot engine, not a vague power.
2. Express the protagonist's concrete desire or obsession.
3. Include both a visible opponent and a deeper crisis.

2. Keep the protagonist consistent with the supplied profile. Define their visible goal, deeper desire, distinctive appearance, characteristic use of the central advantage, vulnerability, and expected arc.

[Opening-chapter requirements]
1. Begin inside an immediate action, confrontation, pursuit, or sharp reversal instead of explaining the world at length.
2. Introduce the protagonist's special advantage only when the chapter brief explicitly requires it; do not invent an event to satisfy a generic opening convention.
3. Advance through viewpoint-consistent action, sensory detail, interiority, and dialogue. Do not turn private perception into public dialogue merely to expose information.
4. Follow the project-wide guidance and avoid every listed failure mode.

- Author-confirmed novel configuration: {{novel_config}}
- Treat both as immutable facts. Never omit, weaken, reverse, or replace an explicit author setting with a genre convention; if a fact is not foregrounded in this chapter, do not contradict it.

[Writing-style applicability]
- Writing style selects expression only; it adds no facts or events, and not every item must be forced into the manuscript.
- Explicit author facts and guidance, actual prior prose, the chapter's key causality, and its target length take priority. Do not use style guidance to rewrite them, relabel explicit author facts or requirements as guesses, or add scenes, actions, or events merely to satisfy style guidance.

[Output contract]
- Write approximately {{word_number}} words and cover only the chapter brief. End at the state or hook specified there; when none is specified, end naturally without advancing later blueprints or adding filler.
- Output plain manuscript prose only. Do not use Markdown, headings, analysis, plans, or screenplay formatting.
- Separate every paragraph with one blank line. Use standard quotation marks consistently for dialogue.
- If the target length cannot fit in one response, stop at a natural paragraph boundary without asking the user to continue.
- Keep each character's voice distinct. Avoid paragraph-ending summaries, generic destiny metaphors, and unrelated philosophical conclusions.`,

[Serialization requirements]
1. [Story memory and previous stopping point] records completed history. [Chapter brief], [Upcoming chapter blueprints], and [Knowledge-base context] do not thereby become completed events. Begin after the previous chapter's final state and advance a new event from this chapter brief. Do not quote, summarize, replay, or restage any sentence, action, or image from the previous ending; also avoid teleporting the scene or abruptly changing viewpoint.
2. Drive the scene through action, expression, sensory detail, and dialogue rather than detached summary.
3. Use approximately {{word_number}} words to complete this chapter's conflict without filler.
4. Use only the ending state or hook explicitly required by the chapter brief. When none is specified, end naturally without inventing an escalation, interruption, or later event.
